# TeamProfileGenerator

As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input. 
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. 
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab. 
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. 
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. 
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu. 
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu. 
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
